## 🚫 INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED

These were **NOT implemented** because they're **LOW IMPACT for mobile**:

❌ Dynamic lighting (subtle, performance cost)
❌ Shadows (subtle on mobile)
❌ Post-processing (performance cost)
❌ Player walk cycle (less visible, lower priority)
❌ Audio system (excluded per user request)

**Reason**: Mobile needs **BOLD, HIGH-IMPACT** visuals. Subtle effects don't show well on small screens.
